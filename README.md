## TODO
### Offer quick rider size toggles
 - Adult/Child (Maybe an age slider?)
 - Male/Female (Probably not a slider!)
 - Bike types

### Supply a list of default bikes
 - Scrape sizes to begin with
 - Find a good source of more accurate information (those catalogues in bike shops might be available online somewhere)
 - Store that somewhere
 - Provide an API 

### Give a bike recommendation?
